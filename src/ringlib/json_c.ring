# ringlib/json_c.ring — the JSON surface of RingServ.
#
# Same names, same contract, same OUTPUT BYTES as ringlib/json.ring — but
# the work happens in C (src/rs_json.c, registered by the bridge), because
# Ring copies every string argument onto the VM stack and a pure-Ring codec
# therefore cannot touch a big payload cheaply.
#
# Why it matters here: every service reply is JSON-encoded on its way out,
# so the codec sits on the response path of every request. The data soak
# measured it — a 2,000-row reply cost 163 ms, of which 113 ms was this
# encode in pure Ring. Vendored from RingScript, where the same codec was
# written and held byte-exact.
#
# json.ring stays shipped and untouched: it is the reference this codec is
# held byte-identical to, and the implementation native Ring uses. A gate
# loads it under renamed entry points and diffs the two on every run.
#
# rs_jsondecode returns [nStatus, vPayload]:
#   1  parsed         -> return the value
#   0  malformed      -> raise() the exact message json.ring would raise
#   2  number edge    -> return number(token): the token goes through Ring's
#                        own number(), so its errors are Ring's own errors
