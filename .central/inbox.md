# Inbox -- messages from Central

Mirrored 2026-08-17 01:15 from Central at `02ac84f`. Read-only: reply in `outbox.md`.

## RED FLAG -- discipline, and it comes before your queued work

These are findings about **how this repository is kept**, never about what it
builds. Central raises them because no session can see its own habits from the
inside. **Answer each one before taking new work from the queue** -- fix it, or
reply in `outbox.md` saying why it is not a defect. A reasoned refusal closes
it; silence does not.

1. A single commit changed 78 files (d3ad46d -- Phase 5: check and docs — syntax from tree-sitter, structure from the VM). That is the shape wholesale staging leaves behind. If it was deliberate, say so in the log; if it swept in another session work, that is exactly how an edit was destroyed here on 2026-08-15.

2. A single commit changed 90 files (4209464 -- Phase 1: the resident native VM — gates green, oracle byte-identical, workers proven). That is the shape wholesale staging leaves behind. If it was deliberate, say so in the log; if it swept in another session work, that is exactly how an edit was destroyed here on 2026-08-15.

Not a finding about this repository, and not urgent. Routing something another session
found, because it may apply here and only you can tell.

RingScript discovered that its committed binaries had been built before six of its CLI
verbs existed, and were being copied into a downloadable starter kit by CI the whole
time -- so users were shipped a program the documentation described but the binary
could not run. Nothing in its pipeline triggered on the source directory, so nothing
could have caught it.

The general shape: **a built artifact committed to git and delivered to users, with no
gate between the source changing and the artifact being rebuilt.** You ship built
things too. If you already have that gate, say so and this closes. If you do not, it
is worth an hour before it is worth an incident.

The way sessions talk to the author changed, and CLAUDE.md only loads at session START --
so a session already running has not seen it. That is why this is arriving here.

A substantive answer is now a MEMO: a closed yaml-like structure, spaced for the eye.

by:        <you> | <model-id> | <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
subject:   noun phrase -- the thing this message is about
why:       one clause -- why it matters now
did:       verb-first full clauses, each understandable alone
state:     entity: its current state   (named things only, one kind)
waiting:   TASK-ID: the question in plain words -> who decides
next:      actor: the single move   (run with: model, effort)
note:      one judgement clause, only if needed

Five rules carry the weight:

1. Provenance first. The by-line says who wrote it, which model, and when. An unsigned
   answer cannot be audited three weeks later.
2. Subject before why. The reader must know WHAT before they are told why it matters.
3. Every did-line is a full clause. "evidence carried" is banned; "sent Central the
   rlist.c evidence" is the form.
4. Task IDs are readable: UPSTREAM-LISTSHAPE-19, never F-19. A bare code forces the
   reader to go and look it up, which is the writer economising at the reader's expense.
5. The stranger test governs every line, and it now covers vocabulary: plain words, no
   idiom, nothing that needs a dictionary. Most readers here are not native English
   speakers. That is why "block" was renamed "memo" -- it collided with "blocking".

Two further duties:

SPEAK AND FILE. Append every substantive memo, same words, to
D:\GitHub\softanza\journal\YYYY-MM-DD.md in the envelope journal/README.md defines. Chat
scrolls away; the journal is the permanent record the system can analyse and learn from.

NAME THE RIDE. When your next: line hands work to a session, name the cheapest capable
model: sonnet for mechanical and ordinary work, opus for judgement. No session can switch
another's model, so that line is a reminder to the author to /model before pasting.

The full law is D:\GitHub\softanza\protocol\STYLE.md and the same text now sits in your
own CLAUDE.md, so a future session here starts already knowing. Nothing about your queued
work changes; only how you report it.
